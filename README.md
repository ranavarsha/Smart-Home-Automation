# Smart-Home-Automation
Smart Home Automation project is built using an ESP32 microcontroller and integrates RFID, relay modules, sensors, and LEDs to simulate a secure and intelligent home environment. The system enhances convenience, security, and energy efficiency by automating control of devices such as lights and fans based on RFID access and environmental data. RFID tags are used to authenticate users and control appliance access, while sensors like DHT11 monitor temperature and humidity, and a PIR sensor detects motion to trigger automatic responses. LEDs represent the status of appliances controlled through relays. This project showcases the integration of key IoT concepts and can be extended with cloud connectivity (e.g., Blynk, Firebase) and voice assistant support for real-world smart home applications.
